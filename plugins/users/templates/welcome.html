      Take a minute to set your Preferences, which among other things, will allow
      you to specify your time zone. This is useful if you'd rather see times displayed
      in your local time, rather than EVE time (GMT).

      Before you can view your character or corporation details, you need to add
      your EVE API Key(s) using "Manage EVE API Keys". If you have multiple EVE
      accounts, you may associate them all with your current user, allowing you
      to access all your accounts and characters quickly and easily.
